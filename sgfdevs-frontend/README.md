# SGF Devs Frontend

This is a work in progress rewrite of our frontend in NextJS and TailwindUI. This is purely experimental at this phase.

## Prerequisites and Setup
* NodeJS >= v18.18
* npm >= 9.5.0

Recommended management of NodeJS environments is through [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

## Local Development
It's likely going to be easier to work on this code from within the `sgfdevs-frontend/` folder. Examples assume you are executing commands from this folder.

Install dependencies:

```bash
➜  sgfdevs-frontend: npm install
```

Starting the local server server:
```bash 
➜  sgfdevs-frontend: npm run dev
   ▲ Next.js 14.0.4
   - Local:        http://localhost:3000
```
